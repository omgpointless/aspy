Use the `aspy_lifestats_stats` MCP tool to get lifetime statistics from Aspy.

Display results showing:
- Total sessions, tokens, and cost
- Model breakdown (tokens and cost per model)
- Tool usage stats (calls, avg duration, success rate)
- Time range (first to last session)

Format large numbers readably (e.g., 1.2M tokens, $12.34).
