// UI rendering utilities
//
// This module previously contained modal rendering code.
// Modal rendering has been moved to views/modal.rs for better organization.
//
// This file is kept for potential future UI utilities that don't belong
// in specific views or components.

// Currently empty - all modal rendering is now in views/modal.rs
